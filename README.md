üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Java, Spring Boot

Data: Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)

Security: Spring Security

Frontend: HTML, JavaScript

Build Tool: Apache Maven

CI/CD: GitHub Actions

üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later

Apache Maven (or you can use the included Maven Wrapper)

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git)
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY

2. Configure the Application
Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file. You will need to configure your database connection details here. For example, to use a PostgreSQL database, you would add:

# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_crm_db
spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# Server Port
server.port=8080

3. Build the Project
This project includes the Maven Wrapper, so you don't need a system-wide Maven installation.

To build the project and package it into an executable .jar file, run:

On macOS/Linux:

./mvnw clean package

On Windows:

./mvnw.cmd clean package

This command will compile the code, run tests, and create a .jar file in the target/ directory.

4. Run the Application
Once the build is complete, you can run the application with the following command:

java -jar target/CustomerRelationshipManagement-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

(Note: The version number in the .jar file might be different based on your pom.xml.)

The application should now be running on http://localhost:8080.

üìÇ Project Structure
The project follows a standard layered architecture:

.github/workflows: Contains the CI/CD pipeline configuration for GitHub Actions.

src/main/java: Main Java source code.

.../controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests.

.../service: Contains the core business logic.

.../entity: Defines the database models (JPA entities).

.../repository: Data access layer for database operations.

.../config: Security and application-level configurations.

src/main/resources:

application.properties: Configuration file for Spring Boot.

static/: All frontend assets (HTML, JS, CSS, images).

Ëá™Âä®Âåñ (Automation) - CI/CD
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/static.yml. On every push to the main branch, it automatically:

Sets up the Java environment.

Builds the application using Maven.

Runs all tests to ensure code integrity.
